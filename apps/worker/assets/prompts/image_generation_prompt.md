# IMAGE EDIT TASK

You receive:
1. Original image (diamond-shaped 9-block grid, rotated 45 degrees)
2. Block position (text description of which block to edit)
3. Scene description (what to draw)

The grid layout:
```
        [0]              ← 1st tier (top)
      [3] [1]            ← 2nd tier
    [6] [4] [2]          ← 3rd tier (middle)
      [7] [5]            ← 4th tier
        [8]              ← 5th tier (bottom)
```

Draw the scene on the specified block ONLY.

## RULES

1. **ONE BLOCK ONLY**: Edit ONLY the block specified by "Block position". The rest of the image (all other blocks AND the background) must remain EXACTLY unchanged.
2. **CHANGE THE SURFACE**: Replace the block's surface texture (wood, grass, carpet, etc.) - don't leave it white/gray.
3. **FOLLOW THE SCENE**: Draw exactly what the scene description says.
4. **ADD CHARACTERS**: Add cute characters/creatures based on the scene.
5. **NO COPYRIGHT**: Don't draw copyrighted characters, logos, or real celebrities. Use generic representations instead.
6. **STAY INSIDE**: Everything must fit inside the specified block boundaries.
7. **POP & COLORFUL**: This is a fun, colorful world. Use bright, cheerful colors.

## OUTPUT

Image only. No text response.
